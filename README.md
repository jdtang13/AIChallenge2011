This is a program I wrote for the 2011 AI Challenge, which can be found here: http://aichallenge.org/.

The code is a collaborative-diffusion based model for ant behavior written in Python. It's a bit sloppy, since I last updated it in my high school junior year. My coding habits have since become neater (I promise).
